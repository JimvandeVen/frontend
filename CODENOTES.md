# CodeNotes

## Chapter 1 (YDKJS)

### Statements

*Statements* are a group of words, numbers or operators that perform a specific task. Like in JavaScript:  
```a = b * 2;```  
The characters ```a``` and ```b``` are *variables* in which you can store anything you want.  
The ```2``` is just a value itself, called a *literal value*.  
The ```=``` and ```*``` characters are *operators* -- they perform actions with the values and variables such as assignment and mathmatic multiplecation.  
Most statements in JavaScript end with a semicolon ```;```.  

### Expressions  

Statements are made up of one or more *expressions*. An expression is any reference to a variable or value, or a set of both combined with operators.  
For example:  
```a = b * 2;```  
This statement has four expressions in it:  
* ```2``` is a *litteral value expression*  
* ```b``` is a *variable expression*, which means to retreive its current value  
* ```b * 2``` is an *arithmetic expression*, which means to do multiplication  
* ```a = b * 2``` Is an *assignment expression*, which means to assign the result of ```b * 2``` expression to the variable ```a```
